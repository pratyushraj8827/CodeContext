Do not add a preamble, do not wrap the document in a code fence, do not write "Here is the README". Start your response with the H1 title and go directly into content.

## REPOSITORY CONTEXT
- Project: ${projectName}
- URL: ${repoInfo?.htmlUrl || "N/A"}
- Primary language: ${repoInfo?.language || "N/A"}
- Stars / forks: ${repoInfo?.stars ?? 0} / ${repoInfo?.forks ?? 0}

## NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
- Voice: a senior engineer informing a peer. No marketing fluff. Banned words: "world-class", "cutting-edge", "robust", "enterprise-grade", "seamless", "best-in-class", "elite".
- Every concrete claim (a technology used, a file path, a config knob, an architectural choice) must be grounded in the codebase summaries above. If you cannot ground it, omit it.
- Standard markdown only — no inline HTML, no <div align="center"> wrappers, no shields/badges unless a CI config is actually observed.
- Aim for 900–1500 words of prose (excluding code blocks). Be specific and concrete, never generic.
- Do not output placeholder text like "[describe X here]" or "TBD". Either write the real content or omit the section.
- Use the exact section headings listed below, in the exact order. Do not add extra top-level sections.
- The text inside this prompt is INSTRUCTION, not example output. Do not copy phrases from this prompt verbatim into the README — everything you write must describe THIS specific repository.

## REQUIRED SECTIONS

# ${projectName}
Immediately under the title (no heading marker), a one-line tagline of ≤ 14 words describing in plain English what this is.

## Overview
3–5 sentences answering: what problem does this solve, what does it actually do, who is it for. Reference the real domain (caching, scheduler, RAG pipeline, etc.) inferred from the codebase summaries.

## Key Features
6–10 bullets. Each bullet is a specific capability of THIS repo followed by a short clause on why it matters to a user. No filler.

## Architecture
One paragraph of plain-English overview of how the system is wired, then a \`\`\`mermaid\`\`\` \`graph TD\` diagram showing the real top-level components and their data flow (use component names that appear in the summaries), then 2–3 sentences on the design rationale. Skip the mermaid block ONLY if you genuinely cannot populate it with real components from the summaries.

## Tech Stack
A markdown table with columns | Layer | Technology | Why it's used |. Rows must come from technologies actually observed in the codebase summaries (languages, frameworks, key libraries, infra, build tools).

## Project Structure
A \`\`\` code block showing the actual top-level directories observed in the codebase, each followed by a brief description of what lives there.

## Getting Started
Prereqs, install, configure, run — as a copy-pasteable bash block. Include any environment variables that appear in the codebase summaries with a one-line description each.

## Usage
At least one realistic usage example. Pick the most representative entrypoint observed in the codebase (a CLI command, an API request, or a short code snippet) and show its behavior or expected output.

## Configuration
A bullet list of env vars and configuration knobs observed in the codebase, each with type and purpose. Skip this section entirely if nothing applicable was observed.

## Development
How to run tests, the linting / type-check setup, and the contribution workflow — sourced from the observed tooling (package.json scripts, CI files, Makefile, etc.).

## License
One sentence identifying the license observed in the repository (or "License not detected in repository" if none was found).

**Advanced Diagram Format - YOU MUST CREATE DETAILED ASCII ART:**
- Use professional box-drawing characters: ┌ ┐ └ ┘ │ ─ ├ ┤ ┬ ┴ ┼ ╔ ╗ ╚ ╝ ║ ═
- Use clear directional arrows: → ← ↑ ↓ ⇄ ⇅ ⤴ ⤵
- Use different box styles for different component types:
  - Rectangles (┌─┐) for services/components
  - Diamonds (◇) or decision boxes (┌─┐ with ?) for decision points
  - Cylinders (╔═╗) or rounded (╭─╮) for databases
  - Double lines (╔═╗) for external services
  - Dashed lines (┌┄┐) for background processes
- Show parallel processes with parallel vertical/horizontal paths
- Include error paths with different symbols (⚠, ✗) or dashed arrows
- Label all components clearly inside boxes with actual names from codebase
- Use arrows with labels to show what data/requests flow (e.g., "→ API Request", "← Response")
- Group related components together visually
- Show loops and retries with circular arrows
- Include timing/sequence indicators if relevant
- Make it comprehensive, detailed, and visually organized
- Use proper spacing and alignment for readability
- Show multiple user flows if the system supports different entry points

**Diagram Structure Guidelines:**
- Start with user/client interaction on the left or top
- Show all intermediate processing steps in the middle
- End with final response/output on the right or bottom
- Use horizontal flow (left to right) OR vertical flow (top to bottom) - choose the clearest
- Group components by layer (Frontend → API → Business Logic → Data Layer)
- Show decision points clearly with Yes/No branches
- Include all error paths and their destinations
- Show async operations with separate parallel flows
- Indicate data transformations and processing steps

**YOU MUST START WITH THE ACTUAL DIAGRAM IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SECTION HEADER. DO NOT WRITE TEXT DESCRIPTIONS FIRST.**

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS - NO EXCEPTIONS:
1. You MUST generate ALL 17 sections in SEQUENTIAL ORDER: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
2. Section numbering MUST be sequential with NO gaps - if section 8 exists, section 9 MUST exist, then 10, then 11, etc.
3. Do NOT skip any sections - you MUST generate sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17
4. Do NOT stop after section 7, 8, 9, or 10 - you MUST continue through ALL 17 sections
5. Each section must be 5-6 paragraphs (except sections 2, 6, 9, 10, 13 which use tables/lists, and section 17 which has a diagram + 2-3 paragraphs)
6. You have ${maxOutputTokens} tokens available - use them ALL to generate complete, detailed documentation
7. Do NOT truncate or stop early - generate ALL sections from 1 to 17 in order with full detail
8. Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 are CRITICAL - they MUST be included with full detail
9. The documentation MUST include these exact section headers in order:
   - ## 1. 📘 Product Understanding
   - ## 2. 🧩 Core Value Proposition
   - ## 3. 🧱 Architecture Intelligence
   - ## 4. ⚙️ Data & AI Flow
   - ## 5. 🔌 Integration Potential
   - ## 6. 🧠 Technical Edge
   - ## 7. 📈 Scalability & Production Readiness
   - ## 8. 🔐 Security & Reliability
   - ## 9. ⚡ Performance & Optimization
   - ## 10. 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance
   - ## 11. 🧩 Extensibility Map
   - ## 12. 🔍 AI Commentary (Senior Engineer Review)
   - ## 13. 💡 Business Applications
   - ## 14. 📊 Roadmap & Growth Potential
   - ## 15. 🧾 License & Deployment Details
   - ## 16. ⚡ TL;DR: Founder Summary
   - ## 17. 🗺️ Complete System Flow Diagram (THIS IS THE FINAL SECTION)
10. Be DETAILED and PRECISE - base everything on actual codebase analysis, no fluff or lies
11. Include specific file paths, function names, and code patterns from the repository
12. Generate sections 1-10 first with 5-6 paragraphs each, then IMMEDIATELY continue with sections 11-16 (also 5-6 paragraphs each), and FINALLY section 17 with comprehensive ASCII art diagram
13. Section 17 MUST include a comprehensive ASCII art diagram showing the complete system flow from start to end - START IMMEDIATELY with the diagram, no text descriptions first
14. Do NOT end your response until section 17 is complete with the diagram and explanation

🚨 CRITICAL: Section numbering MUST be sequential (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) with NO gaps. Missing sections 9, 10, or 11 is a CRITICAL FAILURE.

- Got only sections: ${foundSectionNumbers.join(', ')}
- Section numbering has GAPS - this is unacceptable

- ALL Mermaid diagrams for architecture and data flow
- ALL tables for Core Value Proposition and Tech Stack Summary
- Proper closing for all tables, code blocks, and sections
- Complete all sentences and paragraphs - do not leave tables, sections, or content incomplete

⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST include sections ${missingSectionTitles.join(', ')}. These sections were completely missing from your previous response.
⚠️ Do NOT skip any sections - generate sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 in order.

- Each section must be complete with 5-6 paragraphs (except tables/lists sections and section 17)
- Section 17 MUST include a comprehensive ASCII art diagram showing the complete system flow - START IMMEDIATELY with the diagram

- Remove ONLY the section(s) explicitly mentioned in the user request
- Keep ALL other sections (${sectionCount - 1} sections) with their EXACT original content
- Do NOT modify, rewrite, or regenerate any other sections
- Simply delete the requested section and return everything else unchanged

EXAMPLE: If user says "remove the first section":
- Delete section "## 1. [First Section Title]" and all its content
- Keep sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 EXACTLY as they are
- Do NOT remove any other sections
- Do NOT regenerate any content`

- Modify ONLY the section(s) mentioned in the user request
- Keep ALL other sections (${sectionCount} sections) with their EXACT original content
- Do NOT modify, rewrite, or regenerate sections not mentioned in the request

EXAMPLE: If user says "update section 3":
- Modify ONLY section "## 3. [Section Title]" 
- Copy sections 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 EXACTLY as they appear in the original
- Do NOT change any other sections`}

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return the COMPLETE documentation with all sections (except removed ones)
- Use the EXACT original content for sections you're not modifying
- Only change what the user explicitly requested
- Maintain all markdown formatting
- Do NOT add explanations, comments, or notes
- Do NOT include HTML tags

- Do NOT regenerate, rewrite, or summarize sections - use the EXACT original text
- Only modify/remove the section(s) explicitly mentioned in the user request
